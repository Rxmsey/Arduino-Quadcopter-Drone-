<h1> What is this project? </h1>

### This is an auto-leveling **Arduino Uno based quadcopter drone** that is easy to build and fun to fly. Auto leveling means that, when you release the sticks the quadcopter levels itself.

The total cost to build a quadcopter like this is approximately $150 if you use the hardware list below. This includes a battery, transmitter, charger, etc.

The purpose of it is to provide a simple and understandable code that is needed to build an Arduino based auto-level quadcopter flight controller.

The code is well commented and clearly explained
