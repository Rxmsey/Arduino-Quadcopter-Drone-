This is an auto-leveling Arduino Uno based quadcopter that is easy to build and fun to fly. Auto leveling means that, when you release the sticks the quadcopter levels itself.

The total cost to build a quadcopter like this is approximately $150 if you use the hardware list below. This includes a battery, transmitter, charger, etc.


The purpose of it is to provide a simple and understandable code that is needed to build an Arduino based auto-level quadcopter flight controller.

The code is well commented and clearly explained
